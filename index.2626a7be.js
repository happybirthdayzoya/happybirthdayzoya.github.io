I still cannot believe that the little baby – you looked very pink, and hence the name -- we cradled in the hospital that May 16 is now 20. Wow. Through the years, I have marveled at you, your talent in art (and music) and writing and anything else you put your mind to is fairly well-known, but what really makes me proud is the other essential things that make you you – your kindness, your love for the oldies and how you look out for them, and the way you always extend a helping hand to those in need, doggies included. Wish you the best for always, and inspired by Mary Oliver I want you to remember these words for the next phase of your life, 'Those who are the world's artists are not trying to help the world go round, but forward.' And this: 'Creative work needs the whole sky to fly in, and no eye watching until it comes to have that certainty which it aspires to have.'

To think that you are actually TWENTY whole years old is ridiculous, and so I refuse to believe it, yea? (Plus, this denial grants me the denial of not being 20 either ehehehe) No, but seriously, I'm so proud of you for all that you've achieved so far and all that I know for a fact you are yet to achieve. Truly taking girlbossing to a new level &lt;3</p>\n<p>Do you remember when the three of us musketeers had our own \"horses\" and farm and whatnot? I honestly hope you get your equivalent of that fairytale, 'coz you so deserve it. And I'm also aware that you're terrible at keeping in touch with us, 'coz you're oh so busy (insert eye roll) and we're out here living our best life (insert me and aru crying over our assignments)... But I genuinely look forward to New Year's just 'coz I know that we're bound to have our little time warped WhatsApp call, and that's all of the blessing I need to keep me going. (And I'm allowed to be cheesy, ok? It's literally your birdayy, if u have an issue, go eat some cheese whilst you're reading these)</p>\n<p>I love you soooo much (giving you a virtual hug).

We often only see the accolades but rarely witness the internal changes and growth one goes through in shaping their self-image. I have witnessed your transformation from a shy little girl seeking self-esteem to a confident butterfly who believes in her own worth, not just how others perceive her.</p>\n<p>I will always remember how you ran to me in Grade 5 to share the news of opening multicultural events two years in a row. I saw a newfound confidence in you. And again, in Grade 10, when we started writing our Individual Research Reports, your interest in culture and identity showed a maturity beyond your years. I admired how you not only thought about yourself but also about those who are victims of others\' extreme viewpoints.</p>\n<p>I would like to end this letter with a wish for you, but before that, a poem by Katherine Craster:</p>\n<p>"A centipede was happy – quite!<br>\nUntil a Toad in fun<br>\nSaid, \'Pray, which leg moves after which?\'<br>\nThis raised her doubts to such a pitch,<br>\nShe fell exhausted in the ditch<br>\nNot knowing how to run."</p>\n<p>My wish for you is to not let anyone act as the Toad in your life. Do not let anyone make you doubt yourself. Remember, entertaining all perspectives does not mean you have to agree with them. I have always cherished how you take responsibility for your decisions and follow them through. Be your own maverick and enjoy life as it unfolds.</p>\n<p>Lots of love and hugs for your birthday.</p>\n<p>Ms Moumita</p>',letter13="Dear Zoya,\n\nIt must be your birthday by the time these words reach you. I honestly don’t know how to start a letter, and you already know I have a terrible way with words, so I guess I'll just get right to the point by saying how thankful I am for having met you this year. I'm so glad that we sat next to each other on the first day of college, that you struck up a conversation with me and that we hit it off so fast. It was absolutely life-changing to me, cause without knowing you I would have undoubtedly wasted another year of being a pathetic loser. You’re one of the kindest and wittiest people I’ve ever made friends with. Being around you is never boring; you have both interesting stories and jokes that send me straight into fits of laughter and helpful insights that influence the way I see the world. I cherish every moment we have shared, whether they were happy times when we just hung out and chilled or “despairing” times when we ground through schoolwork. The day we visited the cat cafe and the park in Highgate Hill will remain forever my fondest memory, as I was so touched by your willingness to make that one-hour travel to the North so that we could spend time together. And I enjoy our night out with Kyna and our date in Covent Garden just as much. I really hope to share more memorable moments like those with you in the future until they become uncountable.\n\nSo yeah thank you for keeping me company, for introducing me to all I've been missing out on and for putting up with my crazy antics and social awkwardness. And also thanks for letting me try curry for the first time, I long for the taste of it every day.\n\nFor your birthday, I wish you good health and happiness, and I sincerely do as those are the things we can’t just get with simply hard work. I wish you luck in achieving all of your goals, but you won't need it since your intelligence and perseverance will have everything figured out perfectly. And most importantly I wish for our time together to last as long as possible cause I have a long to-do list that I would love to go through with you (can’t wait for submission to be over so we can have more days out and go get good food T.T).\n\nI guess that’s all I want to say, and that’s quite an abrupt conclusion but again, I suck with words. With all my heart though, I wish you the happiest birthday ever!\n\nLove,\nKhue",letter14="<p>Hey there human!</p>\n<p>The first time I met you, you were stern and stoic with your pen in art class. Huddled in your circle there was a Ying and Yang with your partner in crime Tanvi. The explosive energy of her mixed with your weird formal yet accepting presence was something I didn’t expect but I welcomed. And boy I did.</p>\n<p>What a unique ride it has been. Now it’s 2019 and you were bold enough to set sail a new vessel. With a masthead of maturity and a stern of confidence, you had landed yourself in Singapore, muddling your way through art school. You set your trail clear and you went straight ahead. I know during this time you had slight bumps and hiccups but every boat ride has had a few waves to break. But that journey had a price that I thought you had to pay, for me you burned your bridges of the past and in a way, it felt as if you threw it away. Friendships and their anecdotes. It had felt forgotten. Oh, how naive I had been. It had all looked as if you had changed until I forcibly had to once 12th grade came to a close.</p>\n<p>Now it’s 2021, I have just landed in Singapore, embarking on my journey called national service, but enough about that. My naive mind had been sucked into the same current you traveled and you swooped in galavanting maturity and adulthood to a mind not yet confident to take control of their ship. Me. I was assured I wouldn’t get lost alone at sea as I could always knock on your door for a friend. There was a special confidence, one that was built on experience and wisdom. Something I had not been acquainted with, differing from yourself back in school. But it was welcomed. You were a person not forgetful of your past but in control of your future and present. That was the missing piece I ignored under my stupidity and is something I admire to this day about you.</p>\n<p>Not only that, there was a special someone you had thrown your heart into. A piece of you held by your trusted comrade. Though a tumultuous and interesting perspective of a human being, Atharva and you shared something I adored, holding back the smile that's creeping on my face. While you stood at the helm of the wheel, he swung at the top of the mast staring into the sea ahead and occasionally cupping his hands to call you down below.</p>\n<p>So it's 2022, and I'm burning through national service, yet again, and you traveled on your way to the UK, forging new stories. I had heard tales of your endeavors with photoshoots and projects stacking your portfolio. Oh, what a ride it has been. You are a book, I occasionally open to get lost in and gauge another world to share and enjoy with. With stories of twists and turns and of adulthood, another year has come, and it's now 2023.</p>\n<p>As I'm writing this letter to you, I take momentary pauses, stare at my screen, and recollect the emotions attached to the memories. Though sometimes far away at sea and completely below the horizon, I can faintly hear your ship bolting full steam ahead into another year. So happy birthday to you! Thanks for the different perspective on this whimsical and crazy world.</p>\n<p>Yours Truly,<br>a person who was corny enough to write this letter,<br>Tejasvin Shrikanth</p>",letter15="<p>Omg I still remember pretending to raise cows with you and go “exploring” and bird-watching like it was yesterday. And that’s saying a lot considering I can’t remember shit.</p>\n<p>What I remember particularly is the feeling of warmth, of home, and zo, you are home. We don’t speak very often, but just the thought of you makes me feel better. You are my anchor to the person I was growing up, the person I should never forget. And there’s something I don’t get to tell you often enough: I LOVE YOUR BUTT.</p>\n<p>Bob, thank you. Thank you for being my friend.

Even though we may not hang out all the time or chat every day, I've always admired your straightforwardness and how much you’ve have grown as a person. I can understand how hard it must have been to go to a new country with strangers at such a young age, but all things considered I hope you’ve been able to have a fresh start with only positivity in your future (channel your best Aleesha energy).</p>\n<p>As you blow out those candles, I want to again wish you an incredible year ahead. May it be filled with exciting adventures, unexpected surprises, and countless memorable moments. I hope you have the chance to explore new horizons, chase your dreams, and create beautiful memories along the way.</p>\n<p>Remember, life is too short to take everything too seriously. So, make sure to laugh, dance, and have fun whenever you get the chance.

Those days you were a super sweet, calm and quiet child, never a tantrum or a bad mood. Your baby days were spent with your Dida mostly, with her care and love you blossomed into a darling little girl. You enjoyed crawling around the house, you used to love your Bengali meals, cooked with great expertise by your grandma mostly and occasionally by your mother.</p>\n<p>Those were extremely happy days, simple and easy. Your face would light up when your dad came home, he was and I think still is your favourite person. He delighted in watching you grow and would love to pick you up and cuddle you. He used to call you his little monkey! The sheer love he displayed was evidence of how happy he was to have you as a daughter.</p>\n<p>You were equally fond of your doggies, your aunts, your little world filled with your family. The evening was your parents' and the day was your grandparents'. So you enjoyed the love and affection of many people.</p>\n<p>Later you started school and I moved away from Bangalore. I still continued to hear of what you liked and how you were progressing. Your interest in creative things, fondness for music, love for animals, and your fiercely independent streak! These were the subject of discussion with your parents over the years.</p>\n<p>Your mother is my dearest friend and sister, and so is your father, the closest to family that I have. It's been years since we could celebrate your birthday together, and this year is another such. I hope you enjoy your day with your friends and do the things you enjoy. My love and blessings will always be with you. The time spent till you were 5 years will continue to stay in my heart. I must say you have essentially remained the same person, and that is a measure of how well you've been brought up. Your personality wasn't shaped by your parents; instead, they encouraged and supported every inclination and talent they observed. Which is why you're not a clone of them but your own unique self. I wish you all the best in your studies and future career. It's my hope you remain happy and healthy and enjoy your life.</p>\n<p>I remember with great fondness your visit to my house in Delhi with your dad. It was wonderful to see you and the beautiful pictures you took!</p>\n<p>Lots of love,<br>Anu Pishi and Mashi!

You are near yet so far. Here's wishing you a blessed, blessed happy birthday. May God always be with you and protect you, with good health and lots of success. We in Dimapur feel so proud of you ❤️ Be the lady you are, so humble and upright. Have a wonderful day. Your parents must be lauded for bringing you up and making you an independent lady.

Even though we drove each other up the wall all the time, there is no one I would’ve rather roomed with FR.</p>\n<p>No one I would’ve rather jammed out to the Kamisama theme song with, posted dancing to it in her towel on my Instagram main, and doing tiktoks where we tried to get just your ass on that plate. Or going to matchaya, or genki. Running down the street like anime lovers, and pretending to be a couple when everyone else was cuffed. Will never forgive you for getting together will athu and leave me single and sad. Or kicking me out of my OWN ROOM, you lil shits.</p>\n<p>I was going through all my Instagram stories the other day and was laughing so hard looking at all the hilarious stupid stuff we used to do together. Like us preparing our room for the scabies quarantine, or you recording me while I was taking class in the living room. And you editing your ugly face onto your Hisoka and Chrollo fan edits. Or putting your phones speaker in your mouth to that weird audio. And coming for all my performances &lt;3. Or watching all of banana fish randomly that evening. And Among Us during lockdown, or that 12 hour lockdown call (honestly why did we do that). So many many good memories with you.</p>\n<p>You’re so strong, kind and caring, and I’m glad to have known you my bro. Stop doubting yourself so much, and believe in yourself more. You’re an amazing, caring and wholesome person. You’re dumb as hell most of the time, but that’s great cause you make me feel smarter. Stop keeping your emotions in and being scared of confrontation. You have so much love to give and receive if only you asked for it!!!! I wish we’d sometimes been more open with each other, we wouldn’t have had most the problems we did have. But its okay, because now I miss what we had. In the end, I’m really glad YOU were my roommate.</p>\n<p>Because as much of a rollercoaster our friendship and time together was, I really cared about you and loved you and miss you a lot now actually!!

All those times at the canal, the park, or the bridge by your place. And when we did the Harry Potter marathon and binged Lord of the Rings and ate lots of popcorn.
